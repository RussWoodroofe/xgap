\>Box( <sheet>, <x>, <y>, <w>, <h>, <defaults> ) O


creates a new graphic object,  namely a filled black  box, on the graphic
sheet <sheet> and  returns a {\GAP} record describing  this  object.  The
four   corners     of  the    box    are   $(<x>,<y>)$,  $(<x>+<w>,<y>)$,
$(<x>+<w>,<y>+<h>)$, and $(<x>,<y>+<h>)$.

Note that the box is $<w>+1$ pixel wide and $<h>+1$ pixels high.

The following functions   can be  used  for  boxes: `in'  (see "in  for
Graphic   Objects"), `Reshape'   (see  "Reshape"),  `Move'  (see "Move"),
`MoveDelta' (see   "MoveDelta"), `Recolor' (see "Recolor"),  and `Delete'
(see "Delete").

If a record <defaults> is given and contains a component `color' of value
<color>, the  function like the first version  of  'Box', except that the
color of the box will be <color>.  See "Color Models" for how to select a
<color>.
