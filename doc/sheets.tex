\Chapter{Graphic Sheets - Basic graphic operations}

This chapter describes how graphics are accessed in {\XGAP} via the lowest
library functions for graphic sheets. These functions are used in all other 
parts of {\XGAP} and you normally only need to know them if you want to
display other things than graphic posets and subgroup lattices.
