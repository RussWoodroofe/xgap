This file describes the changes from xgap4r16 to xgap4r17:

 * XGAP now reports "4.17" as version number instead of "4.16".

 * PackageInfo.g file is now supplied.

 * The new package loading mechanism is therefore supported.

 * A documentation package is generated.

 * The global variable 'last' is set in init.g to make the XGAP package
   autoloadable.
